The project had reached the point where it was **playable** in "player vs player" mode, with walking animations...
However, it lacked in-game sound and the item functionality (non-essential, but fun).

I was planning to record the gameplay after fixing these ishues, but I haven't found the time. Later, after the pandemic striked and I returned to my home city, I wanted to finish the project, but a malfunction caused during transportation appeared. I realised it was possible, but difficult to fix the problem and I decided to start over and build the project in a better, more modular way, such that any component could be easily replaced should a malfunction appear again. Thus I could not take the final footage and I did not finish the documentation for this version. :(
