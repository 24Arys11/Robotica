### Neat things:
* Sound system could play up to 30 songs (sound effects, mellodies, ...) simultaneously ! Only the sound with the highest priority (or the most recent if priorities are equal) will be heard, however, a background song will continue after the top song finishes. Thus, songs can interrupt each other dynamically.
* Matrix Manager renders every position (set of 4 leds) individually, each having it's own refresh rate. Thus the game displays very efficiently and is able to run smoothly.
