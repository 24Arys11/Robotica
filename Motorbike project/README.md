# Motorbike-project

## Description:

It's a very cool, 3D printed, self ballancing motorbike controlled via radio-commands.

## Features:

Self ballancing: It uses a servo motor and a weight to keep it's ballance - (well it's not perfect, yet..)

Directions (8 possible): right, right-forward, forward, left-forward, left, left-backward, backward, right-backward.

* When you use right or left, with or without movement (forward or backward) the turning signals on the appropriate side are going to blink automatically.

All the stops are active by default, but when you move forward (with or without steering) the 4 small LEDs on the back are turned off.

Horn - triggerd by the button of the controller
Lights (toggleable) - SW joy button. (powerfull 10 LEDs light)
